       <h4>It is no coincedence that people gain muscles after going to the gym.</h4>
       <h2 class="em">But what do you do at the gym to maximize your gains at the Gym?</h2>
       <br>
       <hr>
       <h1>Here are 3 fundamental every gym begginers <em>should</em> know. </h1>
       <br>
       <h1>1.Consistency</h1>
        <p>If you have blackheads under your eyes from rigorous work weeks, would you
            rather sleep everyday at a consistent time to fulfill your sleep needs or 
            sleep 2 entire days and then work for next week?
        </p>
        <p>I bet you nobody chose that 2nd option. Then what makes us think lifting weights
            is any diffrent? 
        </p>
        <p>If we show up to train everyday at the gym, there is a 101% chance you will gain muscle in the next 30 
            days. No buts or ifs. Being consistent is the very first step to achieve any goal and gym is the same.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h1>2.Nutrition</h1>
        <p>Your body NEEDS fuel in order to function.</p>
        <p> When you put more strain on your body and eat
            as if you just came from the movies or a vacation, what would you expect?</p>
        <p>  That your body will recover slower than usual. But for maximizing your gains
            you NEED to increase your nutrition intake.
        </p>
        <p>You need eating more protein(i.e, eggs,chicken,curd etc.) in order to have optimal
            muscle recovery.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h1>3.Progressive Overload</h1>
        <p>You would have heard many people say that more weights = more muscle. But this is 
            wrong.
        <p> For a beginner, who have never touche a weight in his life, benching 50kg right 
                off the bat will surely tear either his pectorial muscle or his bicep.</p> 
        <p>Bottom line is, start off easy. Most guys can easily start with 5-7kg weights if they're in their late-teens and for a girl in late-teens, 2.5kg
            weight should be easy for her.</p>
        <p> Keep on using this weight for your workout for 1 week.</p>
        <p> Then, increase by an amount you can handle. That's generally 1lbs for beginner. As your muscles increase
            your intensity threshold should increase as well.</p>
            <p> This is known as Progressive Overload,
            and it will help you in the coming years.</p>
